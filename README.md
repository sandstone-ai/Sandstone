# Sandstone
*The AI that remembers everything your organization has ever learned*

---

## Introduction

Every day, your organization makes hundreds of decisions. Each choice carries hard-won wisdom, context, and reasoning that took years to develop. But when key employees leave, when teams reorganize, or when crisis hits, that institutional knowledge vanishes—forcing you to repeat mistakes, lose momentum, and rediscover solutions that already exist somewhere in your company's collective memory.

Sandstone changes that. We're building the AI platform that captures, preserves, and intelligently surfaces your organization's decision-making wisdom exactly when you need it.

**The ultimate benefits:**
- **Make better decisions faster** by instantly accessing relevant precedents and outcomes from your organization's history
- **Eliminate repeated mistakes** that cost time, money, and competitive advantage
- **Preserve competitive intelligence** that would otherwise disappear when key people leave
- **Accelerate new hire productivity** from months to weeks by giving them instant access to institutional wisdom
- **Build true competitive moats** through compounding organizational intelligence that gets smarter with every decision

## The Problem

**Corporate Amnesia** is the systematic loss of institutional knowledge, decision-making context, and organizational wisdom that occurs when critical information isn't captured, shared, or preserved effectively.

**$31.5 billion.** That's how much Fortune 500 companies lose annually by failing to share knowledge, according to International Data Corporation (IDC). The average large business loses $47 million per year from inefficient knowledge sharing alone.

**The main causes of corporate amnesia:**

- **Employee Turnover**: When experienced employees leave, their decision-making patterns, relationships, and contextual knowledge disappear with them
- **Information Silos**: Critical decisions and reasoning get trapped in departmental bubbles, email threads, and informal conversations
- **Poor Documentation**: Most organizations capture what was decided, but not why it was decided or how the reasoning evolved
- **Tool Fragmentation**: Decision context is scattered across Slack, email, meetings, documents, and tribal knowledge with no central intelligence
- **Time Pressure**: In fast-moving organizations, teams don't have time to properly capture and share decision rationale
- **Cultural Gaps**: The "unwritten rules" and cultural context that guide decision-making are never explicitly preserved

**The devastating daily impact:**

- **Repeated Mistakes**: Teams making the same errors because they can't access lessons from similar past decisions
- **Lost Context**: New executives spending months learning "how we do things here" instead of focusing on strategy  
- **Decision Paralysis**: Leaders lacking confidence because they can't quickly access relevant precedents and outcomes
- **Cultural Drift**: Organizations losing their decision-making DNA during growth or leadership transitions
- **Reinvented Wheels**: Teams spending weeks solving problems that were already solved elsewhere in the company

The average Fortune 500 company has 20+ years of decision-making patterns buried in emails, Slack channels, meeting notes, and departed employees' heads. This isn't just data—it's the strategic intelligence that defines competitive advantage.

## The Solution

Sandstone is the institutional memory platform that transforms organizations into continuously learning entities.

**How it works:**

1. **Capture Everything**: Automatically ingests decision context from all communication channels—Slack, email, meetings, documents, and 50+ enterprise tools—while preserving the full genealogy of how decisions evolved
2. **Build Intelligence**: AI creates comprehensive organizational twins that learn your decision-making DNA, cultural patterns, stakeholder relationships, and strategic reasoning across individual, team, and company levels
3. **Map Connections**: Constructs interactive knowledge graphs showing decision dependencies, outcome patterns, and influence networks that reveal how your organization really works
4. **Surface Wisdom**: Proactively delivers contextual intelligence—relevant precedents, lessons learned, and expert insights—exactly when and where decisions are being made
5. **Accelerate Leadership**: Provides executive briefings, succession planning blueprints, and instant onboarding that compress months of institutional learning into actionable intelligence

**Key capabilities:**

- **AI Twins**: Individual, team, and company-wide AI models that preserve decision-making patterns even after employees leave
- **Knowledge Capture & Interaction**: Passive capture from all communication channels, contextual recording of decision genealogy, and intelligent Q&A across institutional memory
- **Decision Intelligence & Analysis**: Pattern recognition that identifies what approaches work (and don't work) for your specific organization, with predictive modeling for future decisions
- **Proactive Context Delivery**: Automatically surfaces relevant historical decisions, outcomes, and precedents at the moment of decision-making
- **Cultural Preservation**: Captures the "unwritten rules," risk tolerance, communication styles, and cultural DNA that make your organization unique and successful
- **Knowledge Mapping & Visualization**: Interactive knowledge graphs showing decision dependencies, stakeholder influence networks, and the evolution of organizational thinking over time
- **Executive Insights & Succession Planning**: Tailored executive briefings, leadership transition blueprints, and comprehensive onboarding/offboarding workflows that preserve critical knowledge transfer
- **Intelligent AI-Assisted Search**: Dynamic search that understands context, intent, and organizational nuance to surface exactly the right information, precedents, and expertise at the right moment
- **Security, Privacy & Governance**: Enterprise-grade access controls, role-based permissions, data lineage tracking, and compliance-ready audit trails
- **Integration & Platform Services**: Seamless connection to 50+ enterprise platforms including Slack, Teams, Salesforce, Notion, and all major productivity tools
- **Analytics & Insights**: Real-time dashboards showing decision patterns, knowledge gaps, time-to-decision metrics, and organizational intelligence evolution

**The result:** Your organization becomes exponentially smarter over time, with every decision building on the full weight of institutional wisdom rather than starting from scratch.

## Why Now?

Three converging trends make this the perfect moment for institutional cognition infrastructure:

1. **AI Maturation**: Large language models can now understand context, reasoning, and cultural nuance at enterprise scale
2. **Remote Work Reality**: Distributed teams need better ways to share and preserve institutional knowledge  
3. **Talent Volatility**: Average tenure continues declining while knowledge-based work becomes more complex

Organizations that build superior institutional memory will have insurmountable competitive advantages in decision speed, quality, and consistency.
